Project Workflow: Optimizing Cell Type Classification Using Deep Learning and Traditional Models


1Ô∏è Data Selection & Preprocessing 


Data Collection
Select two large scRNA-seq datasets (200,000+ cells each) from cellxgene database.

Make sure the datasets contain diverse cell types to allow robust classification.

Select datasets with imbalanced distributions of cell types (use cases where minority classes exist).


  2 Data Preprocessing
Perform data cleaning: normalize gene expression values (log normalization, scaling).
Perform data cleaning: filter out low-quality cells (e.g., those with excessive mitochondrial gene expression or too few expressed genes).
Perform feature selection to reduce dimensionality if needed. 

Perform Feature selection:  gene filtering (if necessary).
Annotate cell types  appropriately  

Prepare datasets for model training: 

  3 Data Splitting 
  
  Sampling Strategy:
Stratified Sampling: Ensure proportions of each cell type remain balanced.

Split data into: Training: 80%, Test: 20%

 4 Reducing data points 
Reduce dataset size while preserving essential patterns.

Stratified Sampling: Reduce dataset size while preserving the distribution of cell types. Preserve essential patterns.  Ensure proportions of each cell type remain balanced.
Sampling Based on Cell Type Distribution: Ensure underrepresented cell types are not lost.
Random Sampling: Compare results with naive downsampling.

5 Model Implementation 

A. Traditional Method: Gradient-Boosted Trees (XGBoost)
Use XGBoost (XGBoost Docs). alternatives : LightGBM, or CatBoost.
Input: Ensure stratified data splitting to keep class proportions.
Optimize hyperparameters for the best performance.

B . Deep Neural Network (DNN)
Model Design 
Choose an architecture suitable for classification (e.g., multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, or transformer-based models).
Implement in PyTorch.
Tune key parameters:
Dropout rate (prevents overfitting).
Learning rate (controls step size of weight updates).
Number of layers (determines depth of the model).
Number of neurons per layer (controls model complexity).
Regularization techniques (L1, L2 penalties to prevent overfitting).
Hyperparameter Optimization


6 Model Training & Monitoring

Logging & Performance Tracking

Training Process
Epochs: One full pass over the entire dataset.
Mini-Batches: Model trains in small batches to improve stability.
Backpropagation: The model updates weights after each batch.


Train both models on:
Full dataset
Reduced dataset

Measure performance using:
Classification Accuracy
F1-score (especially important for imbalanced cell type distributions)
Computational Cost (runtime, memory usage) 
Analyze and Interpret Results

Compare results to see how dataset reduction affects performance. 
Compare performance metrics across models and dataset sizes.
Identify trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.
Provide recommendations on how much dataset size can be reduced without significant loss of accuracy.

Evaluate model performance using:
